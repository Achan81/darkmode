# README

## Deployment: 
Deployed on Netlify [**here**](https://achan81-darkmode.netlify.app/ "here")

## A small repo to test darkmode on a single page app.
- darkmode.js 
- https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/
- not 100% sure if i like it enough to keep using it...

----

* **PROS** 
  * library - lightweight, and seemingly straight forward, and fairly simple to use.

* **CONS**
  * when applying to an existing project, I appear to have some unknown conflicts blocking the darkmode from working the way i want it to.
