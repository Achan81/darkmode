        <p className="col fw-normal">In my short time of web developing, I have learnt and made apps but not had the time to push certain features.</p>
        <p className="col fw-normal">Dark mode has always been something that I wanted to inject into my projects. Since my immersive course has ended and having completed my developer launch portfolio (mvp), I now want to add additional features.</p>
        <p className="col fw-normal">The main framework I have been using has been Bootstrap 5.  I haven&apos;t found any obvious darkmode ready tool for this, so have been researching into darkmode tutorials for beginners. I found a few to experiment with, such as halfmoon, but the easiest appears to be darkmode.js.</p>
